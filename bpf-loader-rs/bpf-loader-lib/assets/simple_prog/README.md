# simple_prog

Here is a simple program to test meta verification and data exporting.

The program is mainly in `simple_prog.h`, which contains several type definitions. The types will be present in BTF.

- `simple_prog.c`: It's a helper program to generate the binary dump of the struct `S`. 
- `simple_prog.btf`: The BTF archive of the `simple_prog.bpf.o`
- `simple_prog.bpf.o`: An BTF file contains only BTF info, which is generated by `ecc` from `simple_prog.h`
- `simple_prog.skel.h`: The JSON skeleton of `simple_prog.bpf.o`
- `dumper_test.bin`: The binary dump of the struct S that `simple_prog.c` filled.
