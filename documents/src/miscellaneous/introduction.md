# introduction

`eunomia-bpf` is a dynamic loading library/runtime and a compile toolchain framework, aim at helping you build and distribute eBPF programs easier.

## Simplify building CO-RE libbpf eBPF applications

Just Write libbpf eBPF kernel code only, auto config the userspace part!

### Automatically exposing your data from kernel

- Get data automatically from `perf event` or `ring buffer` to userspace:

    ```c
    struct {
      __uint(type, BPF_MAP_TYPE_RINGBUF);
      __uint(max_entries, 256 * 1024);
    } rb SEC(".maps");

    SEC("tp/sched/sched_process_exec")
    int handle_exec(struct trace_event_raw_sched_process_exec *ctx)
    {
      ....
      e = bpf_ringbuf_reserve(&rb, sizeof(*e), 0);
      ....
      bpf_ringbuf_submit(e, 0);
      return 0;
    }
    ```

    Compile and Run the program:

    ```console
    $ ecc bootstrap.bpf.c bootstrap.h
    Compiling bpf object...
    Generating export types...
    Packing ebpf object and config into package.json...
    $ sudo ./ecli examples/bpftools/bootstrap/package.json
    TIME     PID     PPID    EXIT_CODE  DURATION_NS  COMM    FILENAME  EXIT_EVENT
    22:01:04  46310  2915    0          0            sh      /bin/sh   0
    22:01:04  46311  46310   0          0            which   /usr/bin/which 0
    22:01:04  46311  46310   0          2823776      which             1
    22:01:04  46310  2915    0          6288891      sh                1
    22:01:04  46312  2915    0          0            sh      /bin/sh   0
    22:01:04  46313  46312   0          0            ps      /usr/bin/ps 0
    ```

    see [bootstrap](../examples/bpftools/bootstrap/bootstrap.bpf.c) for example. This is exactly the same as [bootstrap.bpf.c](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf-bootstrap/blob/master/examples/c/bootstrap.bpf.c) in [libbpf-bootstrap](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf-bootstrap) project, but only kernel code is needed.

### Automatically sample the data and print `hists` in userspace

- Sample the data from hash maps and print them in human readable format with comments:

    ```c
    /// @sample {"interval": 1000, "type" : "log2_hist"}
    struct {
        __uint(type, BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH);
        __uint(max_entries, MAX_ENTRIES);
        __type(key, u32);
        __type(value, struct hist);
    } hists SEC(".maps");
    ```

    and Get `hist` data from `hists` map and print them in human readable format:

    ```bash
    $ sudo ecli  examples/bpftools/runqlat/package.json --targ_per_process
    key = 8326
    comm = containerd

          usec              : count    distribution
            0 -> 1          : 0        |                                        |
            2 -> 3          : 0        |                                        |
            4 -> 7          : 0        |                                        |
            8 -> 15         : 0        |                                        |
           16 -> 31         : 2        |*************                           |
           32 -> 63         : 2        |*************                           |
           64 -> 127        : 6        |****************************************|
          128 -> 255        : 0        |                                        |
          256 -> 511        : 2        |*************                           |
    ```

    see [examples/bpftools/mdflush.bpf.c](../examples/bpftools/runqlat/runqlat.bpf.c) for example.

### Automatically generate and config command line arguments

- Automatically generate and config command line arguments for your eBPF program from the comments in your kernel code:

    ```c
    /// Process ID to trace
    const volatile pid_t pid_target = 0;
    /// Thread ID to trace
    const volatile pid_t tgid_target = 0;
    /// @description User ID to trace
    const volatile uid_t uid_target = 0;
    /// @cmdarg {"default": false, "short": "f", "long": "failed"}
    /// @description target pid to trace
    const volatile bool targ_failed = false;
    ```

    and Get:

    ```console
    $ sudo ecli  examples/bpftools/opensnoop/package.json -h
    Usage: opensnoop_bpf [--help] [--version] [--verbose] [--pid_target VAR] [--tgid_target VAR] [--uid_target VAR] [--failed]

    Trace open family syscalls.

    Optional arguments:
      -h, --help    shows help message and exits
      -v, --version prints version information and exits
      --verbose     prints libbpf debug information
      --pid_target  Process ID to trace
      --tgid_target Thread ID to trace
    ```

    see [examples/bpftools/opensnoop/opensnoop.bpf.c](../examples/bpftools/opensnoop/opensnoop.bpf.c) for example.

- `100%` compatible with `libbpf`, [libbpf-bootstrap](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf-bootstrap/tree/master/examples/c) and `libbpf-rs`, etc: you can compile [libbpf-tools](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/libbpf-tools) kernel code with `eunomia-bpf` and run them without many modification!
- Not limited to tracing: support `tracepoints`, `kprobe`, `uprobe`, `lsm`, `xdp`, `tc` etc...

## Compile and pack CO-RE eBPF kernel code to a config file

- Compile and pack CO-RE eBPF kernel code to a `JSON` or `YAML` config file:

    ```console
    $ ecc cmd/test/opensnoop.bpf.c opensnoop.h
    Compiling bpf object...
    Generating export types...
    Packing ebpf object and config into package.json...
    $ docker run -it -v `pwd`/:/src/ ghcr.io/eunomia-bpf/ecc-`uname -m`:latest # build with docker for x86_64 and aarch64
    Packing ebpf object and config into package.json...
    ```

    You can modify the config file and config the eBPF program behavior to your need.

## Dynamic load and run CO-RE eBPF kernel code from the cloud with URL or OCI image

- you can dynamically load it on different kernel version without recompile, and without clang/llvm dependency:

    ```console
    $ sudo ecli opensnoop.json
    TIME     PID     TPID    SIG     RET     COMM
    22:58:28  77121  3168    0       0       cpptools-srv
    22:58:29  69044  3168    0       0       cpptools-srv
    22:58:29  3014   2906    0       0       code
    22:58:29  6952   4061    0       0       node
    22:58:29  4061   3937    0       0       node
    22:58:29  75263  3168    0       0       cpptools-srv
    22:58:29  2906   2488    0       0       code
    22:58:29  69149  3168    0       0       cpptools-srv
    22:58:29  73541  3168    0       0       cpptools-srv
    22:58:29  73468  3168    0       0       cpptools-srv
    22:58:29  2906   2488    0       0       code
    22:58:29  69094  3168    0       0       cpptools-srv
    ```

- Get pre-compiled eBPF programs running from the cloud to the kernel in `1` line of bash, kernel version and architecture independent:

    ```bash
    # download the release from https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/eunomia-bpf/releases/latest/download/ecli
    $ wget https://aka.pw/bpf-ecli -O ecli && chmod +x ./ecli
    $ sudo ./ecli https://eunomia-bpf.github.io/eunomia-bpf/sigsnoop/package.json # simply run a pre-compiled ebpf code from a url
    $ sudo ./ecli sigsnoop:latest # run with a name and download the latest version bpf tool from our repo
    ```

- very small and simple! The library itself `<1MB` and no `LLVM/Clang` dependence, can be embedded easily in you project
- as fast as `<100ms` and little resource need to dynamically load and run eBPF program

Base on `eunomia-bpf`, we have an eBPF pacakge manager in [LMP](https://github.com/linuxkerneltravel/lmp) project, with OCI images and [ORAS](https://github.com/oras-project/oras) for distribution.

## [wasm-bpf](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/wasm-bpf): Write user space code for your eBPF program in WebAssembly

see [wasm-bpf](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/wasm-bpf) project:

A WebAssembly eBPF library, toolchain and runtime powered by [CO-RE](https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/bpf/blog/2020/02/19/bpf-portability-and-co-re.html)(Compile Once â€“ Run Everywhere) [libbpf](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf) and [WAMR](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime).

- **`General purpose`**: provide most abilities from eBPF to Wasm, `polling` from the ring buffer or perf buffer, bidirectional communications between `kernel` eBPF and `userspace` Wasm using `maps`, dynamically `loading`, `attaching` or `detaching`, etc. Supports a large number of eBPF program types and map types, covering the use cases from `tracing`, `networking`, `security`.
- **`High performance`**: No `serialization` overhead for complex data types, using `shared memory` to avoid copy overhead between host and Wasm.
- **`Easy to use`**: provide a similar developing experience as the [libbpf-bootstrap](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf-bootstrap), `auto generate` the Wasm-eBPF skeleton headers and type definitions for bindings.
- **`Ultralightweight`**: the sample runtime has only `300+` lines of code, binary only `1.5 MB` in size. Compiled Wasm module would be only `~90K`. With the same toolchain, you can easily build your own Wasm-eBPF runtime in any languages and platforms!

## Project Architecture

we have a loader library, a compile toolchain, and some additional tools like cli and a custom metrics exporter.

### An bpf-loader-rs library

A wrapper of main functions of libbpf-rs, provide the ability to dynamically load eBPF code to the kernel and run it with a simple JSON and a few API.

A [simple cli interface](../ecli) is provided for bpf-loader library, which you can use it to start any eBPF program from a url in a command. You can download it from [release](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/eunomia-bpf/releases/).

see [examples](../examples) for more examples.

### A library to load and operate eBPF program from a WASM module

Use the `eunomia-bpf` library to load `eBPF` program from a `WASM` module, you can write a WASM module to operate the eBPF program or process the data in user space `WASM` runtime. The idea is simple:

1. compile the kernel eBPF code skeleton to the `JSON` format with `eunomia-cc` toolchain
2. embed the `JSON` data in the `WASM` module, and provide some API for operating the eBPF program skeleton
3. load the `JSON` data from the `WASM` module and run the eBPF program skeleton with `eunomia-bpf` library

You can have multiple `eBPF` program in a single `WASM` module.

See [wasm-runtime](../wasm-runtime) for details. In fact, `ewasm` library only exports a few functions from `bpf-loader` library to the `VM`, so you can replace the `WASM` runtime with your own easily.

For example, you can run an eBPF program with a WASM module for an URL:

```bash
sudo ./ecli run https://eunomia-bpf.github.io/eunomia-bpf/sigsnoop/app.wasm
```

You can also generate a WASM program template for eBPF or build WASM module with `compiler` container:

```shell
# for x86_64 and aarch64
docker run -it -v `pwd`/:/src/ ghcr.io/eunomia-bpf/ecc-`uname -m`:latest gen-wasm-skel # generate WASM app template for eBPF
docker run -it -v `pwd`/:/src/ ghcr.io/eunomia-bpf/ecc-`uname -m`:latest build-wasm    # Build WASM module
```

see [sigsnoop example](examples/bpftools/sigsnoop) for more detail.

### A compile toolchain to help you generate pre compiled eBPF data

The toolchain can be used as a docker to generate pre-compiled eBPF data in one command:

see the compile toolchains [compiler](compiler) for details.

you can also simply use the [ebpm-template](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/ebpm-template) repo as a template in github, just push to it and github action can help you compile CO-RE ebpf code!
