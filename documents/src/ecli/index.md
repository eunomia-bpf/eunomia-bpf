# ecli: run ebpf programs as json or wasm

## Usage

```sh
sudo ecli <COMMAND>
```

## example

Run the ebpf program as wasm or json.

```sh
# run with wasm bpf modules
sudo ecli run runqlat.wasm
# run with json bpf object only
sudo ecli run package.json
```

Or run the ebpf program as a tar file contains minimal BTF info and bpf object.

```sh
sudo ecli run client.tar
```

The ecc packaged tar contains custom btf files and `package.json`, which can be run on older kernels.
