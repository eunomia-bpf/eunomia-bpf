### Usage

```sh
ecc [OPTIONS] <SOURCE_PATH> [EXPORT_EVENT_HEADER]
```

Compiles and generates a bpf object from the provided SOURCE_PATH path for the specified eBPF program.

### example

#### package.json only

```sh
ecc foo.bpf.c
```

#### Source file and a header file

```sh
ecc foo.bpf.c bar.h
```

#### Generate custom btfhub-archive and package into tar

```sh
ecc -b client.bpf.c event.h
```

This command will compile client.bpf.c and event.h into client.bpf.o,
and package them as json, export a tar containing a custom btf file.

output in `OUTPUT_PATH`:

```sh
package.json
client.tar #include custom btf files
```

### btfhub Support

[BTF](https://github.com/aquasecurity/btfhub) is the things that make eBPF portable.

`btfhub` provide BTF information for Linux distributions released kernels
that don't have embedded BTF information.

By using btfhub to package ebpf programs as tar file,
ecc makes it possible to run ebpf programs on older kernels that do not have btf support.

[A list](https://github.com/aquasecurity/btfhub/blob/main/docs/supported-distros.md)
of existing distributions and their current status on eBPF and BTF support.


### Arguments and options

#### Arguments

- `SOURCE_PATH`: path of the bpf.c file to compile

- `EXPORT_EVENT_HEADER`: path of the bpf.h header for defining event struct


#### Options

- -o, --output-path `OUTPUT_PATH`: path of output bpf object
- -w, --workspace-path `WORKSPACE_PATH`: specify custom workspace path
- -a, --additional-cflags `ADDITIONAL_CFLAGS`: additional cflags for clang
  - example `-a="-fstack-protector"`,
  this avoids runtime errors on some distributions that have clang stack protection enabled by default.
- -c, --clang-bin `CLANG_BIN`: path of clang binary (default: clang)
- -l, --llvm-strip-bin `LLVM_STRIP_BIN`: path of llvm-strip binary (default: llvm-strip)
- -s, --subskeleton: do not pack bpf object in config file
- -v, --verbose: print the command execution
- -y, --yaml: output config skel file in yaml
- --header-only: generate a bpf object for struct definition in header file only
- --wasm-header: generate wasm include header
- -b, --btfgen: fetch custom btfhub archive file and package into tar
  - If `BTFHUB_ARCHIVE` does not exist, it will clone
  [btfhub](https://github.com/aquasecurity/btfhub-archive) to `BTFHUB_ARCHIVE`.
  - This option will take a lot of time, if you don't want to package or generate all custom btf files,
  you can keep only the required btf files in `BTFHUB_ARCHIVE`.
  - Don't worry, even the tar containing all the btfhub archives is only `5-10MB` in size.
- --btfhub-archive `BTFHUB_ARCHIVE`: directory to save btfhub archive file (default:`$HOME/.eunomia/btfhub-archive`)
- -h, --help: prints help documentation.
- -V, --version: prints version information.
