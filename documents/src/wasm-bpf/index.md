`Wasm-bpf` is a WebAssembly eBPF library, toolchain and runtime powered by [CO-RE](https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/bpf/blog/2020/02/19/bpf-portability-and-co-re.html)(Compile Once – Run Everywhere) [libbpf](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf). It can help you build almost every eBPF programs or usecases to `Wasm` with nearly zero modification, and run them cross platforms with Wasm sandbox.

## ⌨️ Introduction

`WebAssembly` (Wasm) is a portable binary format for executable code. The code is executed at a nearly-native speed in a memory-safe (for host) sandbox, with clearly defined resource constraints, and APIs for communicating with the embedding host environment (eg. proxy).The `wasm-bpf` project combines Wasm and eBPF technologies to enhance the performance and programmability of eBPF applications.

With `wasm-bpf`, users can dynamically load and securely execute user-defined or community-contributed Wasm-eBPF codes as `plug-ins` in their software products, such as observability platforms or service proxy. This enables efficient and scalable data collection, while also allowing for advanced processing and analysis of that data.

It also enables developers to write eBPF programs in familiar languages like `C/C++`, `Rust`, `Go`, and more than 30 other programming languages, and deploy them easily across different Linux distributions. Additionally, cloud providers can leverage wasm-bpf to offer a `secure` and `high-performance` environment for their customers to develop and deploy eBPF applications in their cloud environments.

## 🚀 Get started

### 📦 Install wasm-bpf

Run the following command to install the `wasm-bpf` CLI tool:

```sh
cargo install wasm-bpf 
```

### Running a standalone Wasm-eBPF program

Running the `runqlat` example with docker:

```console

For more tools to distribute and deploy Wasm-eBPF programs for usecases from `Observability`, `Networking` to `Security`, please refer to [eunomia-bpf](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/eunomia-bpf) repo.

### Embed a Wasm-eBPF function in your program

Add the following line to your Cargo.toml to use Wasm-bpf as a `library`:

```toml
wasm-bpf-rs = "0.2.2"
```

## Features

- **`General purpose`**: provide most abilities from eBPF to Wasm, `polling` from the ring buffer or perf buffer, bidirectional communications between `kernel` eBPF and `userspace` Wasm using `maps`, dynamically `loading`, `attaching` or `detaching`, etc. Supports a large number of eBPF program types and map types.
- **`High performance`**: No `serialization` overhead for complex data types, using `shared memory` to avoid copy overhead between host and Wasm.
- **`Easy to use`**: provide a similar developing experience as the [libbpf-bootstrap](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf-bootstrap), `auto generate` the Wasm-eBPF skeleton headers and type definitions for bindings. Write your eBPF programs in `C/C++`, `Rust`, `Go` and compile to Wasm.
- **`Ultralightweight`**: the miminal runtime has only `1.5 MB` in binary size. Compiled Wasm module would be only `~90K`. With the same toolchain, you can easily build your own Wasm-eBPF runtime in any languages and platforms!

See the [examples](examples) directory for examples of eBPF programs written in C, Rust, Go and compiled to Wasm, covering the use cases from `tracing`, `networking` to `security`.

For tools to distribute Wasm-eBPF programs in [`OCI`](https://opencontainers.org/) images, please refer to [eunomia-bpf](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/eunomia-bpf) repo.

## How it works

An eBPF application typically consists of two parts: the `user space part` and `the kernel space part`. With wasm-bpf, the user space part is executed in a WebAssembly (Wasm) sandbox while the kernel space part is executed in the eBPF runtime in the Linux kernel. This separation of concerns allows for greater flexibility and security in developing and running eBPF programs, as well as the ability to leverage the benefits of both Wasm and eBPF.

The wasm-bpf runtime require two parts: `the host side`(Outside the Wasm runtime) and the `Wasm guest side`(Inside the Wasm runtime).

- host side: A simple runtime implementation example
  - see [runtime/cpp](runtime/cpp), which would be a sample runtime in `C++` built on the top of [libbpf](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf) and [WAMR](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime). Another more complex runtime implement in `Rust` is [runtime/wasm-bpf-rs](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/wasm-bpf/tree/main/runtime/wasm-bpf-rs), based on [Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime).
  - You can easily build your own Wasm-eBPF runtime in `any` languages, `any` eBPF libraries and `any` Wasm runtimes with the same System interface.
- wasm side: toolchains and libraries
  - a [`libbpf-wasm`](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/wasm-bpf/tree/main/wasm-sdk/c/libbpf-wasm.h) header only library to provide libbpf APIs for Wasm guest `C/C++` code.
  - a [`bpftool`](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/bpftool/tree/wasm-bpftool) tool to generate the Wasm-eBPF `skeleton` headers, and `C struct definitions` for passing data between the host and Wasm guest without serialization.
  - `Rust`, `Go` and other language support is similar to the `C/C++` support.

For details compile process, please refer to the [examples/bootstrap/README.md](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/wasm-bpf/tree/main/examples/bootstrap/README.md).  The figure below shows the overall interaction between the eBPF and Wasm runtimes:

![wasi-bpf](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/wasm-bpf/tree/main/docs/wasm-bpf-no-bcc.png)

A Wasm module could load and control multiple eBPF programs at the same time, and can call another Wasm module written in other languages to process the data or control with [the component model](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model).

We have proposed a new WASI issue [wasi-bpf](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/issues/513).

## Build the runtime

We have two types of runtime samples:

- A C/C++ runtime example, which is a minimal runtime based on WAMR. see [runtime/cpp](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/wasm-bpf/tree/main/runtime/cpp) for more details.
- A Rust runtime example, which is a more complex runtime based on Wasmtime. see [runtime/wasm-bpf-rs](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/wasm-bpf/tree/main/runtime/wasm-bpf-rs) for more details.

The runtime can be built as a library or a standalone executable. see [docs/build.md](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/wasm-bpf/tree/main/docs/build.md) to build the runtimes.
