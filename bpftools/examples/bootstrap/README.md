## Bootstrap

`bootstrap` is an example of a simple (but realistic) BPF application. It
tracks process starts (`exec()` family of syscalls, to be precise) and exits
and emits data about filename, PID and parent PID, as well as exit status and
duration of the process life. With `-d <min-duration-ms>` you can specify
minimum duration of the process to log. In such mode process start
(technically, `exec()`) events are not output (see example output below).

`bootstrap` was created in the similar spirit as
[libbpf-tools](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/tree/master/libbpf-tools) from
BCC package, but is designed to be more stand-alone and with simpler Makefile
to simplify adoption to user's particular needs. It demonstrates the use of
typical BPF features:
  - cooperating BPF programs (tracepoint handlers for process `exec` and `exit`
    events, in this particular case);
  - BPF map for maintaining the state;
  - BPF ring buffer for sending data to user-space;
  - global variables for application behavior parameterization.
  - it utilizes BPF CO-RE and vmlinux.h to read extra process information from
    kernel's `struct task_struct`.

`bootstrap` is intended to be the starting point for your own BPF application,
with things like BPF CO-RE and vmlinux.h, consuming BPF ring buffer data,
command line arguments parsing, graceful Ctrl-C handling, etc. all taken care
of for you, which are crucial but mundane tasks that are no fun, but necessary
to be able to do anything useful. Just copy/paste and do simple renaming to get
yourself started.

Here's an example output in minimum process duration mode:

```console
$ sudo ./bootstrap -d 50
